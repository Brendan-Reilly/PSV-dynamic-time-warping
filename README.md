# PSV-dynamic-time-warping
The accompanying code for Hagen et al. (2019, GJI). 

Notes:
-All of the .m scripts are required to be located in the same directory in order to run the PSV DTW algorithm. 
-The only .m script that the user needs to open and run is DTW_Angdiff.m. 
      -This code is commented with instructions on which lines need to be changed to run your data (primarily changing directories to match your files)
